<h1>Solution: Design Phase</h1>

<p>
    I created an app using a consistent
structure that most users are familiar
with. From he customer’s view, users
can now schedule a food for future and as
well save their favorites meal for
easy order.
<br> <br>
Design methods used during the project
include journey mapping, user personas,
usability study and prototyping test.

    The customer research and interview 
questions revealed that customers want
to be able to schedule an order prior
to when they need the food and also like
to choose either pick-up or delivery
option. This will prevent staying long on
the queue.
<br> <br>
I also make an option for users to 
give special instructions on how they 
want their food. This option is for
those making a future order. The app was
designed so that every customer can
interact easily with it.

            While designing the Azina Kitchen app, 
I learn that the goal of my design must be 
center on the user and I must not allow 
biases creep into my design. Also learnt how 
important usability study and feedbacks 
play a significant role in 
UX designing
