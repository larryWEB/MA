<h1>What to do?</h1>

<p>
    The goal is  to create a social good
app platform for people with diabetes so
that they can monitor and check their
sugar level. This I must do by using the
research result.
</p>

<p>
    Since this is a health project, designing
    for various platform must be considered.
    So I decided to design a cross platform
    application.
</p>

</section>


<div class="designprocess">
    <h1>Design Process?</h1>

    <p>
        It is time to start the design and the 
first thing to start with is either your
paper wireframe or digital wireframe.
This allow you to quickly put down your
ideas and iterate.

<h1>Digital Wireframe</h1>

anatomy without focusing on other visual
elements like colors, icons, typography and
so on.
<br><br>
Below are some of the digital wireframe sketch
of the Dia-Control app.

        also set a reminder on when they would like to use their pills.
        <br><br>
        The Sugar level was created with a nice interface for user
        to interact with. The sugar scanner can be added via bluetooth
        so that the sugar level can be added automatically once
        sugar level is checked.</p>

            with different abilities and
