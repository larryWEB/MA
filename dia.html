that are not visible to people around.
<br> <br>
We want to share the pains with them
and that is why we are creating the app
that will help them live a healthy life.
Patients are having challenges with
some Diabetes app out there and some of 
the challenges are

<h1>User Research Summary</h1>

<p>
    Conducting the interviews helped me to
know what users expect in the app and why
they want it. My target audiences are
users with diabetes from the age of 16 to
65 and I was able to highlight their
common pains and needs. With this I can
come up with the solutions.

<section class="what">
<h1>What to do?</h1>

<p>
    The goal is  to create a social good
app platform for people with diabetes so
that they can monitor and check their
sugar level. This I must do by using the
research result.
<br><br>
    Since this is a health project, designing
    for various platform must be considered.
    So I decided to design a cross platform
    application.
</p>

<div class="designprocess">
    <h1>Design Process?</h1>

    <p>
        It is time to start the design and the 
first thing to start with is either your
paper wireframe or digital wireframe.
This allow you to quickly put down your
ideas and iterate.

<h3>Digital Wireframe</h3>

<p>
    The purpose of digital wireframe is to make
the stakeholder focus on the app structures or
anatomy without focusing on other visual
elements like colors, icons, typography and
so on.
<br><br>
Below are some of the digital wireframe sketch
of the Dia-Control app.

                        I have learnt a lot of things but the key
lesson I learnt as a designer is Iteration on
designs. Research helps me to iterate on my
project and that way I can give users what they
want and not what I want in a websites.
